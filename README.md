Mini Project: Comprehensive Sequence Analysis of the Human TNF Gene

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for the BioinformHER  Mini Project, focusing on the sequence analysis of the human TNF gene. The TNF gene encodes a proinflammatory cytokine known as Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), and this project aims to apply bioinformatics techniques learned in the module to analyze and interpret its sequence.

Project Objectives:

The main goal of this project is to leverage bioinformatics skills to perform a detailed analysis of the human TNF gene sequence.

Tasks:

1. To download the human TNF gene sequence and view it using BioEdit.
2. Translating the gene sequence into amino acids
3. Identifying Open Reading Frames (ORFs) 
4. Analyzing sequence Composition
5. Identifying Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS)
6. Searching for Functional Motifs 
7. Predicting Coding and Non-Coding Regions
8. Converting the TNF gene sequence from FASTA format to PHYLIP format

Tools Utilized:

1. NCBI: A comprehensive database offering access to various sequence data and bioinformatics resources.
2. BioEdit: A widely-used biological sequence alignment editor for alignment, editing, ORF detection, and visualization of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.
3. PROMO: A web-based tool for identifying and predicting transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in DNA sequences, aiding in the understanding of gene regulation.
4. MEME Suite: A core tool for motif elicitation, useful for identifying and visualizing functional motifs in biological sequences.
5. GENSCAN: A computational tool designed to predict coding (exonic) and non-coding (intronic) regions in DNA sequences.
